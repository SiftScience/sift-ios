 * Manage files of a directory exclusively, meaning, no two

 * There is a special file called the current file, and you may rotate
 * it to make it non-current.  The current and non-current file are
 * guarded by different locks and so you may access them simultaneously.
 *
 * NOTE: We use file name pattern to distinguish current and non-current
 * files. A file named "data" is the current file, and a file with name
 * like "data-\d+" is a non-current file (and non-current files are
 * ordered serially).  Other files are ignored and not managed at all
 * except when you remove the entire directory.  You may exploit this
 * feature to store (meta-)data alongside the managed files.
 *
 * Methods return YES on success.
