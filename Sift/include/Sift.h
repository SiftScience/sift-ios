/**
 * This is the main interface you interact with Sift.
 *
 * The Sift object is stateful and is configured post initialization.
 * See the "Configurations" section below for details.
 *
 * The Sift object is built on top of event queues.  Every queue is
 * identified by an `identifier` and has a `SFQueueConfig` object.
 * You should plan event queues based on batching and latency needs,
 * not by the actual event types you are sending to the queues (an
 * upload collects events from all the queues and submits them in one
 * request; so there is no point to create an event queue solely based
 * on types of events).  Note: There is a default event queue and that
 * is probably all you need.
 *
 * Methods return YES on success.
